I developed my first rolls of film in the new darkroom. One roll was from last week, the other was one that was shot ages ago and forgotten in the fridge.

I used my [plastic tank and reels]({{< ref "/equipment/tanks_reels" >}}) and D-76 in the 1:1 dilution. I get all my development times from the [massive development chart](https://www.digitaltruth.com/devchart.php) and their Android app (which doubles as my timer).

Once the negatives were dry, I cut them into strips of five and put them in Print File sheets. I used the ones that take seven rows of five images, these are nice because I can leave them in the sheets when I do a 8Ã—10" contact sheet. I have a few of the ones that take six images across, and I'll probably have to use one of those when I develop the 36 exposure roll of Tri-X I currently have in my camera.

To get a quick look at the images without mixing chemistry for printing, I taped a piece of tracing paper to a window, and taped the print file sheet on top of that. Then I took a photo of the sheet of negatives with my phone and inverted the image and adjusted the black and white points in Photoshop.
