I processed and scanned another two rolls of film a few days ago. One roll was freshly shot a couple of weeks ago in the Stephenville area. The other one was left in the camera with some shots exposed in 2012, 2015, and the last ten only a few weeks ago. This was all hand-rolled Kodak Tri-X, developed in D-76. I'm hoping to shoot and process another few rolls before I get into the darkroom and start printing.
