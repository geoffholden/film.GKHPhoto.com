These are the tanks I have for developing film. They were all given to me when I started my first darkroom. I usually use the plastic tank and reels, because it's so easy to load the film onto the reel (and the reel is adjustable for different film sizes). The downsides to the plastic ones are that you can't load the film at all unless the reel is *perfectly* dry (I know this from experience, as I had to fumble around in the dark to find the stainless reel one time), and that they use a little more developer to cover the reel.
