This camera and the [Yashica A]({{< relref "yashica-a" >}}) are from my father (I believe this one is officially a loan). I haven't actually shot with either one yet, but I do have a few rolls of T-Max 100 in 120 cold storage and ready to go; part of the issue there is that [my enlarger]({{< relref "../printmaker35" >}}) can't project medium format without an expensive upgrade kit.
