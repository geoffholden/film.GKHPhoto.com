This camera and the [Yashica Mat-124G]({{< relref "yashica_mat-124g" >}}) are from my father (I believe the 124G is officially a loan). I haven't actually shot with either one yet, but I do have a few rolls of T-Max 100 in 120 cold storage and ready to go; part of the issue there is that [my enlarger]({{< relref "../printmaker35" >}}) can't project medium format without an expensive upgrade kit.
