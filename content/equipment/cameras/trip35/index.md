This is another camera that I picked up from a local seller. To be honest, I bought this one mostly because of the cult classic status that it seems to have, so I figured I had to try it. It's a pretty simple camera, it's fully automatic, powered by a selenium cell surrounding the lens, so it doesn't need batteries at all. It's set up for zone focus, so there's no double image rangefinder. It has four zones: single person (1 meter), two people (1.5 meters), group of people (3 meters), and mountains (infinity).

The lens itself is a fixed 40mm Æ’/2.8 and is said to be amazingly sharp, even in the corners of the image (where most lenses fall off a bit).
