This, along with the [AV-1]({{< relref "av-1" >}}), was one of the first film cameras that I purchased in 2009 that started me down this rabbit hole. I got both cameras, the power winder, and a 50mm Æ’/1.8 all for either $25 or $30 from a local seller. One of the cameras had some light leaks when I ran my first test roll through it, so I stripped out the old seals and replaced them with some adhesive-backed black felt from a craft store. I also replaced the battery door, which is apparently a common issue with the AE-1. For a while I just had it sealed up with black tape, but it looks a lot better with a proper door on there.
