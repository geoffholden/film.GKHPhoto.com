  title: Negative Carriers
---

This is my new enlarger. Saved from the garbage, and I think it was partially assembled and never used. From my brief research on the matter, these were sold without a lens or negative carrier included, and I think the original purchaser didn't realize this, so the enlarger was never used. I managed to secure myself a 35mm negative carrier and both 50mm and 75mm enlarging lenses. I drew up the outline for the 35mm carrier, as well as a 6×4.5cm, and a 6×6cm and had them laser cut out of acrylic. The bottom piece is 1/4" black acrylic, the top is 1/8" clear that's been spray painted (top and sides only) flat black to stop any stray light. I'm including the file I used here: {{% link "Negative Carriers.pdf" %}}Negative Carriers{{% /link %}}.

The other issue I had moving to this enlarger is that it really wants above the lens filters, but I only have a *very old* set of below the lens Kodak Polycontrast filters (they only go from 1 to 4 in half steps, the more modern ones go from 0 or 00 through 5, but other than that they seem to work fine on Ilford Multigrade paper). Luckily, the enlarger did come with a red safety filter that you can swing in front of the lens so that you don't accidentally expose your paper, so I used that as a guide and made a under the lens holder that can take my old filters or the red safety filter.
