      <title>Developing Tanks &amp; Reels</title>

      <description>These are the tanks I have for developing film. They were all given to me when I started my first darkroom. I usually use the plastic tank and reels, because it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to load the film onto the reel (and the reel is adjustable for different film sizes). The downsides to the plastic ones are that you can&amp;rsquo;t load the film at all unless the reel is perfectly dry (I know this from experience, as I had to fumble around in the dark to find the stainless reel one time), and that they use a little more developer to cover the reel.</description>

      <description>Printmaker 35   This is a small enlarger that I received with my initial batch of darkroom equipment. I picked up the manual on eBay afterwards, partially to know for sure where the condenser lens goes (on the bottom of the lamp housing, not on one of the &amp;lsquo;shelves&amp;rsquo;). It&amp;rsquo;s a condenser enlarger, with a 50mm lens installed for 35mm prints. It can project up to 11x14&amp;rdquo; on the baseboard, and larger if you reverse the column and project onto the floor.</description>

      <title>Darkroom</title>

      <description>Finished Darkroom   My darkroom is a 9&amp;rsquo;4&amp;rdquo; Ã— 6&amp;rsquo;4&amp;rdquo; room in my basement. Along one side is a custom cabinet with both open and closed storage, and a single drawer underneath. The top is some kitchen counter top that I salvaged when the installers put a scratch in it. Above the cabinet, I strung some rope between two L-brackets that I can use to hang prints to dry.</description>
