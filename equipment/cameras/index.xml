      <description>Canon AE-1   This, along with the AV-1, was one of the first film cameras that I purchased in 2009 that started me down this rabbit hole. I got both cameras, the power winder, and a 50mm ƒ/1.8 all for either $25 or $30 from a local seller. One of the cameras had some light leaks when I ran my first test roll through it, so I stripped out the old seals and replaced them with some adhesive-backed black felt from a craft store.</description>

      <description>Canonet 28   I picked up this camera on eBay in 2009 for less than $20. The only issue with it is that it requires a PX625 mercury battery that is no longer readily available. Without the battery installed, it can only operate at a fixed shutter speed of 1&amp;frasl;30 with a manually set aperture. On many of these older cameras, the mercury cell was used because it has a stable voltage&amp;ndash;it stays at 1.</description>

      <description>This is another camera that I picked up from a local seller. To be honest, I bought this one mostly because of the cult classic status that it seems to have, so I figured I had to try it. It&amp;rsquo;s a pretty simple camera, it&amp;rsquo;s fully automatic, powered by a selenium cell surrounding the lens, so it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need batteries at all. It&amp;rsquo;s set up for zone focus, so there&amp;rsquo;s no double image rangefinder.</description>

      <description>Yashica A   This camera and the Yashica Mat-124G are from my father (I believe the 124G is officially a loan). I haven&amp;rsquo;t actually shot with either one yet, but I do have a few rolls of T-Max 100 in 120 cold storage and ready to go; part of the issue there is that my enlarger can&amp;rsquo;t project medium format without an expensive upgrade kit.</description>
